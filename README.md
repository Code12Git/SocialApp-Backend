# Social Media App (MERN Stack)

This is a social media application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The app allows users to connect, share posts, and interact with each other in a social media environment.

## Features

- User Registration and Authentication: Users can sign up and log in to their accounts. Authentication is implemented to secure user data and restrict access to authorized users.

- User Profiles: Each user has a profile page that displays their information, posts, followers, and following. Users can update their profile information, such as profile picture, bio, and contact details.

- Post Creation and Viewing: Users can create new posts containing text, images, or links. They can view posts from other users on their timeline or explore posts from different users on the platform.

- Interaction and Engagement: Users can like posts, comment on them, and follow other users to stay updated with their activities. The app provides real-time notifications for interactions and updates.

- News Feed: The app generates a personalized news feed for each user, displaying posts from the users they follow.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user data, posts, comments, and other relevant information.

- Express.js: Backend framework for handling API routes, request handling, and database interactions.

- React: JavaScript library for building the user interface. Allows for dynamic rendering of data and interactive user experiences.

- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for running server-side logic, processing requests, and interacting with the database.
